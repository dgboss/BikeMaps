* Hazard deletion
* Find out why firewall says that we're pron?

###LOWER PRIORITY

* User login cookies to prevent having to sign in every time
* opt in for emails (double opt in if possible)
* add bikelanes from OCM
* add new alerts badge to navbar bell
* Option to report for different person
* Documentation for future devs
* improve incidents heatmap
* flagged comment alerts for admins
* Pictures of hazards uploading
* Make use of AJAX to prevent unnecessary page redirects. Leaflet.AJAX for geojson data?

###BUGS

* Date picker does not scroll with modal
* Leaflet draw does not work for mobile (currently using double tap work-around for mobile)


##FROM TRISALYN
BikeMaps â€“ Functionality
-	Intersection search
-	Linking the occurrence of a near-miss, crash, and theft to weather.
-	Alert emails to include graphics
-	Prize entry for registered users
-	Sliders and query tools on the website so people can see where recent crashes are or the difference between day and night incidents.


##FROM HOLLAND
- Greating message with tour of site on first visit
- Help button hard to see
- Basemap highway colors are too similar to legend colors


##FROM DARREN
- When you search for a word/phrase that returns multiple results, the text of the results is truncated. 
	Try searching for 'shell' for example. The list of results should probably expand horizontally to accommodate 
	the width of the result items or the text in the result items may even need to wrap if it is sufficiently long

- The search function doesn't seem to work from my Android phone.

- When using a phone, it would be nice if the address bar could be
	hidden as it occupies valuable screen real estate, especially when in landscape mode.


##FROM MARTIN
- More obvious reporting buttons
